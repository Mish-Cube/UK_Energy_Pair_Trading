Pair Trading Methodology

1) Find two stocks (instruments) that are causally related
2) Find the linear combination of them that has a time series mean of zero
3) Bet that a deviation from zero will return to zero

In more depth:

1)  Correlation is easy to find, partly because random noise generates tons of non-causal correlation.
    Trying to find genuine causal relationships isn't easy, and we use mostly non-mathematical methods
    for this bit, e.g. here we find two energy stocks that are correlated, and assume there's some causal
    factor that we can trust (oil supply, new green technology, etc etc) to affect both.

    The Engel-Granger test (1987) is designed to take us from 1) to 2): take two time series whose means
    vary over time, and who correlate with each other, and produce a time series whose mean is stable. To
    do this we need our two time series to be I(1): order of integration 1. This means that the mean varies,
    however on short (?) time scales [for trading, this might mean e.g. over one day] fluctuations don't
    affect the mean. There will exist a combination of both that is I(0): even long term fluctuations don't
    affect the mean.

    To begin, we verify that out two series are indeed I(1) by using the ADF test. This does something along
    the lines of testing for reversion to the mean in a random walk - H_0 is "random walk", so an ADF
    statistic close to zero is insufficient to reject the null hypothesis (non-stationary). A highly
    negative ADF statistic (-3 ish) is sufficient to conclude reversion to the mean (stationary).

   | In our data, we find all four UK energy stocks are likely to have I(1).         |
   |                                                                                 |
   | We first conclude the order of integration is larger than 0 - this is typically |
   | sufficient for concluding I(1), as I(2) or higher order behaviour is indicative |
   | of extremely nonstandard market behaviour. For completeness, we check conclude  |
   | for I(2) behaviour and find no evidence, allowing a confident belief in I(1).   |
   |                                                                                 |
   | Now all I(1) stocks can be cointegration tested.                                |

    With four I(1) stocks, and therefore 6 possible pairs to test, Engel-Granger was run.

    No test statistic surpassed -3.05 (all p-values were larger than 0.1), implying no
    significantly cointegrated pairs exist in our small data set. The closest result was
    SSE (formerly Scottish & Southern Energy) vs NG (National Grid), at 0.1004.

2)  With a Hedge ratio of 2.10 and an Intercept of -475, these two produce a fairly
    robust looking mean-reverting spread (epsilon(t)).

    Having trained on the complete timeline of data (2018-2026), we're going to get
    overfit results if we try to backtest on our data set. Instead, a rolling window
    approach will be used. After 252 data points (1 year), and every 21 data points
    (1 month) thereafter, a beta value will be calculated based on all available past
    data.

    Beta, in this case, varies between 0.64 and 2.1. This 3x fluctuation is indicative of
    high variability, for very weakly cointegrated stocks. The initial poor p-value seems
    to have successfully predicted that SSE and NG are not a stable pair to trade on.

    Having identified this, we will not proceed with simulating profits from trading on
    these stocks from 2019-2026. To close, we investigate briefly the business models of
    SSE vs NG in the last 8 years.

SSE and NG are both primarily UK based energy companies, with NG also covering north
eastern US. SSE exclusively focuses on energy, and is actively trying to transition
into renewable energy. NG, however, deals in both energy and gas. They clearly have a
larger invested interest in the success of gas as an energy source - it follows that
the business strategies of these two companies would look very different, especially
as technologies and policies across the industry change, causing asymmetric effects.

With larger sets of historical data, or more energy companies, it is possible that a
stronger cointegration effect is found among UK energy suppliers. Our recommendation
here us to avoid using only modern data when pair trading leading UK energy stocks.
